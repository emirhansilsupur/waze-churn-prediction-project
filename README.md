# waze-churn-prediction-project
This repository contains the project related to preventing user churn on the Waze navigation app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using it. Our project primarily focuses on monthly user churn analysis, with the aim of increasing user retention and contributing to Waze's growth.
